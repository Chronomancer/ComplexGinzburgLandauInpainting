Simple Implementation of Digital Image Inpainting with Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation in Matlab

CGL(Img0, mask0, TIME, dt, eps)

Img0 - gray scale input image with damages

mask0 - binary image that marks the areas of the damages

TIME - maximum number of iterations

dt - time step for iterative solution

eps - epislon, less than 1, I used 0.2 ~ 0.5
